# BreakoutClone

This is a sample project used in my talk at [Java User Group Saxony in May 2019](https://jugsaxony.org/veranstaltungen/114/explore_3d!_echtzeitgrafikprogrammierung_mit_unity/). It is basically a clone of the classic game Breakout to showcase on how the get a game prototype done with Unity in a very short time. The project was created with Unity 2019.1.1f1 Personal on Mac.

## What this project covers
In the talk I gave an overview about the basic principles of Unity. This game covers the following:

- Scripting with Unity
- Simple physics
- GameLogic mechanics
- Materials
- A very basic UI
- PostProcessing

The creation of the game was done in a live session, this sample code contains some more comments but is fairly near to the code created in the session.

## What this project does not cover
The steps on how to create the final game aren‘t covered but due to it‘s simplicity should be easy to figure out. If you need some help feel free to contact me!
